Its goal is to identify and classify discrete objects in an image, such as cars, people, or animals, and draw bounding boxes around them. YOLO is designed to detect objects with well-de\u0000ned boundaries. It works best when the objects are relatively large, clearly separated, and the number of objects is small or moderate.\n"

        "Scale and occlusion handling: CSRNet handles varying scales (people far away or close) and occlusions better than YOLOv3.\n",
        "Not reliant on bounding boxes: CSRNet doesnâ€™t need to detect each individual person as a distinct object, whereas YOLOv3 struggles with overlapping or occluded objects.\n",
        "Task-specific design: CSRNet is specifically designed for crowd counting, while YOLOv3 is a general object detector, making CSRNet more accurate in this specialized task.\n",
        "In conclusion, CSRNet is better suited for crowd counting tasks, particularly in dense crowds, due to its specialized architecture that focuses on generating density maps rather than relying on object detection like YOLOv3."
